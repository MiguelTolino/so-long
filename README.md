This project is a very small 2D game. Its purpose is to make you work with textures, sprites, and some other very basic gameplay elements.

You must create a basic 2D game in which a dolphin
escapes Earth after eating some fish. Instead of
a dolphin, fish, and the Earth, you can use any
character, any collectible and any place you want.
